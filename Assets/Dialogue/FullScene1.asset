  - (Mark and his friend, Frank are on their way to their shift as bartenders.)
  - "(They\u2019re carpooling and are on their way to work when\u2026)"
  - '"What the hell is up with this traffic?"'
  - "\"I swear, you can give these idiots a one way street and a green light and
    there\u2019ll still be traffic on the way to the bar.\""
  - '''Dude chill out. We got like 40 min still until our shift.'''
  - "'The bar isn\u2019t going anywhere and it's not like it\u2019s gonna blow up
    or anything.'"
  - '"Well, if it did blow up, Chris would still make us come in to serve the same
    three people who keep that awful bar in business."'
  - '"Nothing man, just the work shift language coming out."'
  - "'Well, this traffic isn\u2019t letting up anytime soon, why don\u2019t you take
    it easy and nap for a bit til we get to work?'"
  - "'If you keep up that talk near Chris tonight, I\u2019d be driving your ass to
    the unemployment office tomorrow morning.'"
  - (Mark simply rolled his eyes with a feeling of regret since he knew Frank was
    right, and dozed off to sleep.)
