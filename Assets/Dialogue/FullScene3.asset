  - '''Mark? Yo, Mark, wake up.'''
  - "\"What? Where the hell are we? This isn\u2019t the bar!\""
  - '''We had a flat tire.'''
  - '''I had to pull over and pull out the spare tire and change it while you slept
    idly by dude.'''
  - '''But I hurt my hand so I need you to drive.'''
  - "\"Why didn\u2019t you wake me up idiot?\""
  - '"How are you gonna work with a sprained hand like that?"'
  - '''Well you looked like you were in a nice dream.'''
  - "'Didn\u2019t want to burst your bubble there Mr. Bubble.' *laughs*"
  - "'Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019ll be fine by the time we get to work.'"
  - "\"Yeah, like he\u2019d care.\""
  - '''You never know dude. Maybe it will be your lucky break!'''
  - (Mark began to drive and started to wonder about that remark.)
  - "\"Mr. Bubbles? That would be a fun title for my game\u2026\""
  - (Traffic stops Mark on his path.)
  - '"Ugh, I wish I could have bubbles and just breeze past these stupid crowds."'
  - '"Hey, that would be a fun level for my game!"'
  - '"Like, Imagine being late to work, and you use a bubble to get around!"'
